## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- 💻 Java (Core Concepts, OOP, Threads, Exceptions)
- 🗃️ MySQL for relational data handling
- 🧠 JDBC (Java Database Connectivity)
- 📈 Git & GitHub for version control
- 📄 Markdown for documentation

---

## 🧠 Core Concepts

- Object-Oriented Programming (Inheritance, Encapsulation)
- Multi-threading for concurrent operations (e.g. email triggers)
- Exception handling for stability
- Relational database design with normalized tables
- Foreign key constraints and indexing for optimized queries

---

## 🧱 Database Schema

The database includes the following main tables:

- `users`: Login and role-based access
- `patients`, `doctors`: Profile info
- `appointments`, `time_slots`: Scheduling logic
- `medical_records`, `payments`, `insurance_providers`, `patient_insurance`
- `reviews`, `notifications`, `specializations`, `doctor_specializations`


The Entity-Relationship (ER) Diagram shows relationships between core entities:
- 1-to-Many: One doctor can have many time slots
- Many-to-Many: Doctors & specializations
- Foreign key constraints and normalized mapping for integrity

---

## 📚 Usage

- **Patient**: Register, login, browse doctors, book appointments, view medical history
- **Doctor**: Login, manage slots, access patient records, write prescriptions
- **Admin**: Oversee the system, verify doctor registrations, analytics

---

## 📦 Future Improvements

- Add GUI using JavaFX or Swing
- Integrate real-time notifications (email/SMS API)
- Add admin dashboards with analytics
- Enable video consultation module
- Support for electronic prescriptions PDF generation
